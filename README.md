## Overview

## Features
- Translate between various Indian languages.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before running the app, you will need to set up an API key for the translation service.

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/theshivam7/BhashaSarthi.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd BhashaSarthi
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Create a `.env` file** in the root of your project and add your API key for the translation service (e.g., PERPLEXITY API):
    ```
    PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

   Make sure to replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual API key.

5. **Run the app**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

6. **Using Expo**:
   - For iOS: Press `i` in the terminal to open in iOS simulator.
   - For Android: Press `a` in the terminal to open in Android emulator.
 
- If you don't have Android Studio or Xcode, you can use the Expo Go app:
     - Download the [Expo Go app for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/expo-go/id982107779) or the [Expo Go app for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&pcampaignid=web_share) from the respective app stores.
     - Open the Expo Go app and scan the QR code displayed in the terminal after running `npm start` to launch the app on your device.
